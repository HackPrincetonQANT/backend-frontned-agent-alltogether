    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a major hurricane in Florida, utility companies face the critical challenge of efficiently restoring power to affected communities. This project analyzes the **Florida Hurricane Power Restoration Problem**, where a single crew must optimally select and repair damaged power distribution sites under strict resource constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A power restoration crew operates from a central depot with a fixed budget of **1000 units** per shift. Each damaged site has three key characteristics:\n",
    "- **Priority Score**: Importance of the site (e.g., hospitals, shelters, population density)\n",
    "- **Repair Effort**: Work units required for complete restoration\n",
    "- **Travel Overhead**: Round-trip cost from depot to site\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Constraints\n",
    "1. The crew must start and end at the depot\n",
    "2. After each site visit, the crew returns to the depot\n",
    "3. Total budget (travel + repair) cannot exceed 1000 units\n",
    "4. All visited sites must be fully restored **except** the last site, which may be partially restored\n",
    "5. Partial restoration yields proportional benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Maximize the total priority score (benefit) by selecting an optimal subset of sites to visit and determining the restoration level for the last site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Structure\n",
    "This notebook explores two algorithmic approaches:\n",
    "1. **Brute Force**: Exhaustive search through all possible solutions\n",
    "2. **Greedy Algorithm**: Efficiency-based heuristic for near-optimal solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze complexity, prove correctness, implement both approaches, and compare their performance on real data."

    "### Key Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all subsets**: For n sites, generate all 2^n possible subsets\n",

    "3. **Feasibility check**: Verify that the total cost (travel + full repairs for all but last) doesn't exceed budget\n",
    "4. **Calculate benefit**: If feasible, compute total priority including proportional benefit from partial restoration of the last site\n",

    "## f) Algorithmic Approach Selection and Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Approach: **Greedy Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the exponential complexity of the brute force approach, we need an efficient heuristic that can handle all 100 sites in reasonable time. The **Greedy Algorithm** provides an excellent trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy approach selects sites based on their **efficiency ratio**—the priority benefit per unit of total cost (travel + repair). By prioritizing high-efficiency sites, we maximize benefit within our limited budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "For each site:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "efficiency = priority / (travel_overhead + repair_effort)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric captures \"value for money\"—sites with high priority and low cost have high efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Strategy Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection Procedure**: Choose the site with highest efficiency ratio among remaining sites\n",
    "2. **Feasibility Check**: Verify that adding this site (including travel) doesn't exceed budget\n",
    "3. **Solution Check**: Continue until no more sites can be fully added, then apply partial restoration to highest-efficiency remaining site\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intuition**: Sites with high priority and low cost provide best return on investment\n",
    "- **Locally optimal choices**: At each step, we make the best immediate decision\n",
    "- **Not globally optimal**: Greedy doesn't guarantee the absolute best solution (unlike brute force), but produces high-quality solutions very quickly\n",
    "- **Practical advantage**: Runs in O(n log n) time vs. O(2^n) for brute force\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate efficiency** for all sites\n",
    "2. **Sort sites** by efficiency in descending order\n",
    "3. **Iterate through sorted list**:\n",
    "   - If site can be fully restored within remaining budget → add it\n",
    "   - If site cannot be fully restored → attempt partial restoration and stop\n",

    "## j) Final Conclusion and Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided hands-on experience with algorithm design, analysis, and optimization through the lens of a real-world problem: power restoration following a hurricane disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Complexity Theory in Practice**\n",
    "   - **Theoretical vs. Actual**: The exponential O(2^n) complexity of brute force isn't just a mathematical curiosity—it has real, severe practical consequences. Even modern computers cannot overcome exponential growth.\n",
    "   - **Scalability Matters**: The difference between O(2^n) and O(n log n) is the difference between \"can only handle 15 items\" and \"can handle millions.\"\n",
    "   - **Asymptotic Analysis**: Big-O notation accurately predicts real-world performance trends. Our measured execution times closely matched theoretical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Algorithm Design Trade-offs**\n",
    "   - **Optimality vs. Efficiency**: Brute force guarantees the absolute best solution but is computationally prohibitive. Greedy provides near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time.\n",
    "   - **Problem Structure**: The greedy approach works well here because high-efficiency sites tend to be good choices regardless of other selections. Problems with more interdependencies might require dynamic programming or other techniques.\n",
    "   - **Heuristic Value**: A fast, good-enough solution is often more valuable than a perfect solution that takes too long to compute—especially in disaster response scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Proof Techniques**\n",
    "   - **Loop Invariants**: Proving correctness requires careful reasoning about what remains true throughout algorithm execution. This builds confidence that code does what we intend.\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal proofs catch edge cases and logical errors that testing alone might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Real-World Application**\n",
    "   - **Problem Modeling**: Translating a real scenario (hurricane restoration) into a computational problem requires identifying key constraints, objectives, and operations.\n",
    "   - **Practical Constraints**: The depot-return requirement and partial restoration rule add realism and complexity beyond textbook knapsack problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Brute Force | Greedy |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "| **Time Complexity** | O(2^n × n²) | O(n log n) |\n",
    "| **Space Complexity** | O(n) | O(n) |\n",
    "| **Solution Quality** | Optimal (guaranteed best) | Near-optimal (heuristic) |\n",
    "| **Max Practical Size** | ~15 sites | 1000+ sites |\n",
    "| **Implementation** | Complex (subset generation) | Simple (sort + iterate) |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Small critical datasets | Production systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Brute Force:**\n",
    "- Very small datasets (n < 20)\n",
    "- Absolute optimality is critical (e.g., life-safety decisions)\n",
    "- Need to verify greedy solution quality\n",
    "- Problem has no known efficient algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Greedy:**\n",
    "- Large datasets (n > 20)\n",
    "- Real-time or near-real-time requirements\n",
    "- Good-enough solutions are acceptable\n",
    "- Problem has greedy-friendly structure (efficiency-based selection works)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personal Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Growth is Serious**: Before this project, I understood exponential complexity theoretically. Seeing execution time literally double with each added site made it visceral and real.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting is Powerful**: The simple act of sorting by efficiency transforms an intractable problem into one solvable in microseconds. Good problem decomposition is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing is Essential**: Performance testing validated our complexity analysis and revealed the practical breakpoints between algorithms. Theoretical analysis guides design, but empirical testing validates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Constraints Matter**: The depot-return and partial-restoration rules make this more realistic than a standard knapsack problem. Real problems rarely match textbook formulations exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algorithm Selection is Context-Dependent**: There's no universal \"best\" algorithm. The right choice depends on input size, solution quality requirements, time constraints, and problem structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "If extending this project, I would explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming**: Could we achieve better solutions than greedy while staying polynomial?\n",
    "- **Multiple Crews**: How does the problem change with k crews working in parallel?\n",
    "- **Stochastic Elements**: What if repair times are uncertain? How do we plan under uncertainty?\n",
    "- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing priority score, total repairs, and equity across communities\n",
    "- **Approximation Guarantees**: Can we prove the greedy solution is within X% of optimal?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project bridged the gap between theoretical computer science and practical software engineering. Analyzing algorithms isn't just an academic exercise—it's essential for building systems that work at scale. The skills developed here—complexity analysis, proof techniques, algorithm design, and empirical validation—are foundational for any computer scientist or software engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In disaster response scenarios like hurricane recovery, **good algorithms save lives**. The ability to quickly compute high-quality restoration plans means communities get power back faster, hospitals stay operational, and families return home sooner. This project demonstrated that the mathematical tools we learn in algorithms courses have real, meaningful impact on the world.\n",
